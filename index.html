                    <p>My Dearest Honey,</p>
                    <p>It's hard to believe it's been five wonderful years since we first confessed our love back in class 8. That evening of June 30, 2019, feels like yesterday, with all the nervousness and excitement we shared.</p>
                    <p>Despite the challenges we faced, especially the 17-month break due to the pandemic, we found our way back to each other in tenth class. The bond we share only grew stronger.</p>
                    <p>These past two years of a long-distance relationship during classes 11 and 12 have been tough, but every moment spent chatting online with you fills my heart with warmth and love. Your pictures still give me butterflies, just like they did the first time I saw you.</p>
                    <p>And oh, Pavithra, hearing you call my name feels like I'm on cloud 99. I've always called you honey, a name that holds all the sweetness and love I feel for you.</p>
                    <p>Though we don't know when we'll meet again, every day spent loving you from afar is a day filled with hope and anticipation. You are my everything, and I can't wait for the day we can be together again.</p>
                    <p>And as you said earlier this year lets fight, reunite and stay together for the rest of our life.</p>
                    <p>Forever and always, Kannayya💓</p>
